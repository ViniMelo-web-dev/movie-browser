# 🎥 Movie Database Website

This project is a **movie database website** that I developed based on a **Figma design**. The main goal is to allow users to search for thousands of movies using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

The project is built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend, and it uses **Appwrite** as the backend manager to handle authentication, database, and storage.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** — Frontend library
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework
